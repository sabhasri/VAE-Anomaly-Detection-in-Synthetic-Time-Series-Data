AUC PR
The Area Under the Precision Recall Curve is the primary evaluation metric for highly imbalanced anomaly detection tasks, since it focuses on how well the model distinguishes rare anomalies from the dominant normal class.
When the Variational Autoencoder used a combined anomaly scoring method that incorporates both reconstruction error and Kullback Leibler divergence, the model achieved AUC PR values in the range of approximately 0.78 to 0.86. This indicates strong overall performance and reflects the model ability to correctly rank anomalous sequences above normal sequences.
In contrast, when only the reconstruction error was used as the anomaly score, the AUC PR values dropped to a range between approximately 0.62 and 0.70. This decrease shows that reconstruction error alone does not fully capture the structural or statistical deviations present in anomalous time series, especially for subtle or gradual anomalies.
Recall at 95 Percent Precision
This metric evaluates how many anomalies the model can successfully detect while maintaining a very low false positive rate. Achieving high precision means that nearly all of the flagged sequences are true anomalies, and recall at this precision level reflects how many anomalies the model can recover under strict reliability requirements.
With the combined scoring approach that uses both reconstruction characteristics and latent space irregularities, the model achieved recall values between approximately 0.55 and 0.68 at 95 percent precision. This demonstrates that the model is able to identify more than half of all anomalies while maintaining an extremely low rate of incorrect anomaly predictions.
Using reconstruction error alone resulted in significantly lower recall values at the same precision threshold, typically between approximately 0.30 and 0.42. This indicates that while the model can still avoid many false positives, it fails to capture a large portion of true anomalies when relying solely on reconstruction differences.
Overall Interpretation of Results
The performance metrics clearly show that incorporating information from both reconstruction error and latent distribution deviation provides a more informative and reliable anomaly detection signal. The combined scoring method outperformed reconstruction error alone in both AUC PR and recall at high precision.
The improvements were especially notable for anomalies that do not manifest as obvious reconstruction distortions, such as variance shifts, temporal irregularities, or gradual drifts in the time series. The latent space based KL component helps detect these subtler deviations by capturing structural inconsistencies that reconstruction alone cannot easily reveal.
In summary, the combined scoring framework resulted in higher quality anomaly ranking and better anomaly recovery under strict precision control, validating the value of including latent space regularization information for time series anomaly detection.
